# 1-hour-challenge

Secret number - a game to guess a randomly generated number. 

When started the game generates a random number, takes in a guess and 

returns a string with the guess and whether that guess is lower or higher than the random number. E.g., “You answered 9. The correct answer is higher.”.

If the guess matches the random number, then a string is returned which confirms this. E.g., “You answered 9. This is the correct answer!”.
